Meat? Hmmm… A lamb chop would be nice about now. I deserve a lamb chop, preferably one dripping with graving on a bed of… can’t talk about any other food. Remember this is the meat folder and I’m on the meat branch. It is now 7:20.

Oh before I close - I’m not going crazy. Git doesn’t erase files. I switched from the desert branch to the master branch once I committed all of my key lime changes(yeah, I know. I broke the rules. No references to any other foods) and the second changed that I made had not appeared in the file once the switch was made. Git might be cool. That’s enough rambling for now. Time to add this lamb chop to the stage!

Oh boy I’m back. The untracked files: ./ 
Yeah that. Long long sigh. I haven’t added anything because I’m not sure what to do. Apparently when I created this file I touched(touch meats.txt) while in the Food directory.
See:
CLM-SMullins:Foods smullins$ touch meats.txt
CLM-SMullins:Foods smullins$ cd Meats
CLM-SMullins:Meats smullins$ git branch
  deserts
  master
* meats

I’m afraid. Yikes, I just admitted that../
