Dang it! Another Screw up. 

I did this: git remote add origin https://github.com/codecalypso/Gitfortress.git
while on the meats branch. I should have been on the master branch. Now the only thing I have on github is the deserts folder. How the heck did that happen while I was on the meats branch. Man, Iâ€™m confused.

Shoulda called this the git chronicles.7:47pm. Feeling a Netflix binge coming on.
